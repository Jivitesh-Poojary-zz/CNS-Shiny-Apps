# Streamgraph Shiny Visualization Tool
  A streamgraph (or "stream graph") is a type of stacked area graph which is displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing, organic shape. Streamgraphs were developed by Lee Byron and popularized by their use in a February 2008 New York Times article on movie box office revenues. [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamgraph)
